# Chainsaw

Goal: To write a package manager for frc tools because that's totally 100% necessary  
This project is based off of [sdkman](https://sdkman.io) and [homebrew](https://brew.sh)  
Might want to just make it a [homebrew tap]
(https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.md)
or [chocolatey package]
(https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages-template)

**Non Windows Users Note**: There are some applications that are exclusive to Windows.
However, you will be able to write robot code regardless of the OS.

## Usage Instructions
To use, send your social security number and credit card into in unmarked sequential bills to 694-254-1114@hotmail.gov

## Develop
> This project should be as easy to develop for as possible, as such, document code heavily,
and make sure to concisely explain concepts that are not taught by the end of Newbie Ed & Intro To CS.  

Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
[Toml's](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/v0.5.0/README.md) are basically json files.
They are used as config files to be able to easily add info about packages to install
