## Windows Instructions

### Windows 10

1. Follow this instruction guide and install the ubuntu terminal https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

### Windows 7

1. Buy Winston a cookie, and offer to do some of his math homework, and he'll write a script to do it automatically. Or just install it manually [here](ismycomputeron.com) *replace with real link when possible*

## MacOS Instructions

1. Type `sudo chmod +x osx` into terminal. `sudo` means to use administrative powers, `chmod` let's you changed the permissions of an object. You can make it read-only, or give you permission to write to the file. In this case, we typed `+x`. This gives us the permission to execute the file like we'll do in the next step
2. Type `. ./osx`. This will execute the script, and install everything. There's an extra dot added before it so that it runs the script within the same shell instead of spawning another shell.
